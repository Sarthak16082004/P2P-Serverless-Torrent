# P2P-Serverless-Torrent
It is a lightweight, browser-based peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the WebTorrent library.  It allows users to share and download files directly using magnet links, with no need for a central server or backend. Everything runs entirely in the browser.
